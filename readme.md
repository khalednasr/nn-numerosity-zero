This repository contains the data and code for generating the main figures of the publication:
    "Spontaneous representation of numerosity zero in a deep neural network for visual object recognition"
    Khaled Nasr and Andreas Nieder
    iScience 2021

The code was written in Python 3.8.5 and depends on the following packages (in addition to the typical packages present in the Anaconda python distribution):
    - PyTorch 1.8.1
    - opencv-python 4.0.1
    - tqdm 4.50.2

- To run the code:
    - Extract "model/trained_cnn.pth.zip.001" in the same directory to obtain the trained CNN model
    - Run main.ipynb
